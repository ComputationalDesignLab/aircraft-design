    "Once more details are available for the airplane, it is important to perform a refined mission analysis to access whether the airplane can still complete the design mission. Accordingly, this section performs mission analysis for the example airplane. Similar to initial sizing, the [mission profile](../example_aircraft.md) is divided into various segments and the weight fraction (or fuel weight) is estimated for each segment. However, the methods used in this section are more refined as compared to the methods used in intial sizing. The additional information about the airplane is incorporated which is computed in various preceding sections. \n",

    "For this demonstration, only the cruise and loiter estimation is refined. Other segments of the mission are assumed to be same as initial sizing. However, if refined models are available for other segments, then those should be used for computing fuel and weight fraction.
