    "# Mission analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This section performs mission analysis for the example airplane. Similar to initial sizing, the [mission profile](../example_aircraft.md) is divided into various segments and the fuel fraction (or fuel weight) is estimated for each segment. However, the methods used in this section are more refined as compared to the methods used in intial sizing. The calculation incorporates additional information about the airplane computed in various preceding sections. For this demonstration, only the cruise and loiter estimation is refined. Other segments of the mission are assumed to be same as initial sizing. However, if refined models are available for other segments, then those should be used for computing fuel and weight fraction.\n",

    "Similar to initial sizing section, the cruise analysis is performed using Breguet range equation but with some differences. In the initial sizing, the value of $C_L$ was computed such that $L/D$ and range is maximized. However, this does not take into account the cruise speed requirement of 200 kts. Hence, in this demonstration, $C_L$ is computed such that the cruise speed is requirement is met. The computed value of $C_L$ is then used to calculate $L/D$ using simple drag model described in [aerodynamics section](../aerodynamics/drag_polar_induced_drag.ipynb). Since the weight of the airplane decreases during cruise, the value of $C_L$ needs to be updated to maintain the cruise speed. Hence, the cruise segment is further divided into smaller segments and the weight is assumed to be constant in each of these segment. Thus, in this refined model, the weight fraction for cruise segment is computed as\n",
