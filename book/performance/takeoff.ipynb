    "This section performs takeoff analysis for the example airplane using the method described in Raymer Section 17.8. The takeoff segment is divided into four parts - ground roll, rotation, transition to climb, and climb over obstacle. Refer to Figure 17.18 in Raymer for a visual depiction of these sub-segments. Hence, total takeoff distance $S_{to}$ is defined as\n",
