    "# Climb gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes climb gradient analysis for the example airplane. This analysis is performed to determine whether the airplane satisfies the climb gradient requirements or not. It is difficult to compute maximum climb gradient at any given condition for a propeller-driven airplane. Hence, in this section, a simple analysis method is used, similar to the method used in [constraint analysis](../constraint_analysis/climb.ipynb). The climb gradient (CGR) is computed as (equation 3.29, Roskam Part 1)\n",

    "where $P$ is the power, $W$ is the weight, and $\\eta_p$ is propeller efficiency. The $S$ is the wing reference area and $\\sigma$ is the ratio of the density at  given altitude to sea-level. Note that this is the same equation used in constraint analysis. However, parameters in this equation are computed using better methods. The best possible climb gradient occurs when $C_L$ is close to its maximum value. This can be dangerous since the aircraft will be flying close to stall speed, and hence, a margin of 0.2 is used as recommended in Roskam Part 1. The $L/D$ can be computed using \n",
