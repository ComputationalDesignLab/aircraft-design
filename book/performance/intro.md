# Performance

This section performs detailed performance analysis for the example airplane. Specifically, takeoff, landing, cruise speed, and climb segments are analyzed. Further more, range and endurance of the airplane are also estimated. Additional performance metrics can also be determined as required. This analysis assumes that airplane is stable and trimmed during these segments. But this should be verfied using the methods described in stability section. Refer to lecture notes and Chapter 17 in Raymer for more details. Following topics are covered in this section:

1. Takeoff
2. Landing
3. Climb
4. Cruise speed
