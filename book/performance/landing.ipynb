    "# Landing\n",
    "\n",
    "This section performs landing analysis for the example airplane using the method described in Raymer Section 17.9. Similar to takeoff, the landing analysis is divided into four parts - approach distance, flare distance, free roll, and braking distance. Refer to Figure 17.19 in Raymer for a visual depiction of these phases. Hence, total landing distance $S_l$ is defined as\n",

    "$$\n",
