    "# V-n Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "This section illustrates how to create a V-n diagram for the example airplane. This diagram relates airspeed to structural loads experienced by the airframe, which are later used for structural analysis. Essentially, it defines operating envelope for the airplane in terms of the maximum maneuvers and speeds. Refer to [FAR Part 23 Subpart C](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-23/subpart-C) for regulations related to airplane structures.\n",
