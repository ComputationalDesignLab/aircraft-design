    "# Operating cost\n",
    "\n",
    "This section computes operating cost for the example airplane. From the perspective of an airline, the operating costs can be divided into direct operating cost (DOC) and indirect operating cost (IOC). The DOC consists of costs associated with flight operations such as fuel, oil, crew, maintenance, depreciation, etc. The IOC comprises of costs for running an airline such as ground facilities, equipment, administrative and overhead charges. Note that it is very difficult to estimate IOC since it is largely based on how an airline is managed. Refer to section 18.7 in Raymer for more details about airline economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the operating cost in this demonstration is based on the assumption that the owner itself is a pilot i.e. the airplane is bought for personal use only. The cost model uses a simple bookeeping and tracking of several costs associated with operating a GA airplane. The primary inputs are flight hours per year and cost of fuel, which are then used to compute various elements of operating cost. Refer to section 2.3 in Gudmundsson for more details. Note that the annual operating cost is estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maintenance cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The maintenance cost is based on the maintenance work hours in a year and the hourly wage for the mechanic who does maintenance. The maintenance work hours is based on several factors such as flight hours flown in a year, refer to section 2.3.1 in Gudmundsson's book for more details. The wage for a certified mechanic is set to $40/hr based on typical wages found online. The number of flight hours per year is set to 300 hours based on Gudmundsson's suggested range of values. Below code block computes maintenance cost for the example airplane."

Due to the large variability in the insurance premium, it is difficult to estimate insurance cost.

A better estimate should be used, if available. Below code block computes insurance cost for the example airplane."
