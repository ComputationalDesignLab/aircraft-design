    "# Installation Thrust\n",
    "\n",
    "The engine data reported by any manufacturer is usually for an \"uninstalled\" configuration i.e. engine performance is computed when it is not integrated into an airplane. Hence, there is usually some loss of power/thrust when engine is installed on an airplane due to interference. This loss of power/thrust needs to be determined and is usually termed as installation effects. Refer to Chapter 13 in Raymer for a detailed discussion about installation effects and how the power/thrust can be calculated in an \"installed\" configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some quantities which are used for the analysis of propeller-based propulsion system (based on Section 13.5-13.7 in Raymer). The advance ratio ($J$) is the ratio between the forward speed of airplane and the tip speed of the propeller. It denotes how fast an airplane is flying as compared to the propeller speed. It is given as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    J = \\frac{V}{n D},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V$ is the forward velocity, $D$ is the propeller diameter and $n$ is the rotation speed. To account for the installation effects, $J$ can be updated using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    J_{updated} = J \\bigg( 1 - 0.329 \\frac{S_c}{D^2} \\bigg),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S_c$ is the maximum frontal cross-section area of engine cowling behind the propeller. For the example airplane, $S_c$ is estimated using the engine width and height obtained earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power coefficient ($c_P$) and thrust coefficient ($c_T$) are dimensionless forms of power and thrust (similar to drag coefficient) which are used in  performance charts of propeller-based propulsion system. They are given as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    c_p = \\frac{P}{\\rho n^3 D^5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_T = \\frac{T}{\\rho n^2 D^4},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is the density, and $P$ and $T$ are power and thrust, repsectively. If an engine is not turbo-charged, then it will lose power as altitude increases. This can computed using (equation 13.10 in Raymer)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    P = P_{SL} \\bigg( \\sigma - \\frac{1 - \\sigma}{7.55} \\bigg),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the ratio of density at given altitude and sea-level density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the thrust ($T$) is computed using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    T = \\frac{P\\eta_p}{V} \\text{ (forward flight)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T = \\frac{c_T}{c_P} \\frac{P}{nD} \\text{ (static thrust)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta_p$ is the propeller efficiency. Computing static thrust is useful when the airplane is starting its ground-roll for takeoff or when it is moving at low-speeds. The propeller efficiency is reduced due to the formation of shock waves at the propeller tip, and hence, should be corrected if the airplane is going to fly at high-speeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, one should account for the drag caused by the propulsion system. These usually include scrubbing drag, cooling drag, and miscellaneous engine drag (drag due to auxilliary system required for operating a piston-powered engine). Hence, the thrust computed should be adjusted to account for this drag. One can either use equations for estimating these drags (equation 13.21-13.23 in Raymer) or use an historical estimate for thrust correction due to these drag values. Based on the recommendations in Raymer, it is assumed that the thrust is reduced by 8% due to the drag associated with propulsion system.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __*NOTE*__: Since the drag due to the propulsion system is accounted here, it should not be included while perfomring drag build-up for the airplane in aerodynamics section\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above equations, static thrust can computed as follows (based on Section 13.6 in Raymer):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine $\\rho$ based on altitude, propeller diameter $D$ (known), and engine power $P$ (known)\n",
    "- Update power $P$ to account for increase in altitude, if required\n",
    "- Calculate $c_P$ using above formula\n",
    "- Use Fig. 13.11 to estimate the ratio $c_T/c_p$\n",
    "- Use static thrust equation to compute thrust\n",
    "- Use the thrust correction factors to compute final thrust\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above equations, forward flight thrust can computed as follows (based on Section 13.6 in Raymer):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine $\\rho$ based on altitude, propeller diameter $D$ (known), and engine power $P$ (known)\n",

    "- Compute advance ratio $J$ using above equation\n",
    "- Update the value of $J$ based on the installation effects\n",
    "- Use Fig. 13.12, $J$, and $c_P$ to compute propeller efficiency $n_p$\n",
    "- Update propeller efficiency, if required\n",
    "- Compute thrust using forward flight equation\n",
    "- Use the thrust correction factors to compute final thrust\n",
    "\n",
    "> __*NOTE*__: If available, performance charts and static test data should be used for forward flight and static thrust calculations.\n",
