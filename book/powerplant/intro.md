# Propulsion System

This section describes the propulsion system sizing for the example airplane. Firstly, engine sizing is outlined using two approaches: using an already available engine and using a rubber engine approach. Next, the propellers are sized based on the maximum power, number of blades and blade power loading. Lastly, installation effects, along with corresponding thrust corrections, are described. An example is also included which demonstrates how to compute thrust at a given conditions. Refer to lecture notes, Chapter 10 and 13 in Raymer, Chapter 14 and 17 in Nicolai and Carichner, and Chapter 5 in Roskam Part 2 for further details. This section is split into the following sub-sections:

1. Engine and Propeller Sizing
2. Installation Effects and Thrust Correction
3. Example Thrust Calculation
