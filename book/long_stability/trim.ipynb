    "# Trim Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines a basic analysis for triming the airplane at given conditions, and hence, determine if the elevator is sized appropriately. At a given condition (such as cruise), the analysis involves computing the pitching moment coefficient $C_M$ of the airplane about CG as a function of elevator deflection or tail incidence. Then, determine what incidence/deflection angle can yield zero $C_M$. Note that changing the tail lift will change the total airplane lift which should be equal to weight (for a steady flight). Hence, free-stream angle of attack needs to be changed. This leads to an iterative process where angle of attack and elevator deflection are to be determined such that $C_{M_{cg}} = 0$ and lift is equal to weight. This can be done using a computer or a graphical analysis.\n",

    "> __*NOTE*__: Trim analysis is usually performed at takeoff and landing conditions to size/validate the horizontal tail and elevator's effectiveness in trimming the airplane.\n",
