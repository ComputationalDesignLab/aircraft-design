    "# Wing Planform Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "This section performs preliminary estimation of various wing planform variables for the example airplane. These variables include: surface area, aspect ratio, sweep, taper ratio, dihedral angle, incidence angle, and twist angle, thickness ratio, and airfoils.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage of the design, empirical methods are used for determining these variables but it is recommended to use carpet plots or numerical optimization to further refine the value of these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that surface area and aspect ratio are already known from initial weight estimation and constraint analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following list outlines the values of the variables for the example aircraft with some justification. For a detailed discussion about each of these quantities, please refer to lecture notes.\n",

    "2. **Sweep**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, sweep ($\\Lambda$) is desired for high subsonic, transonic, and supersonic speeds where shock formation has adverse effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing. However, it does increase wing weight and decreases the lift. Since the example airplane is going to fly at low speeds ($M \\sim 0.3$), the leading edge sweep is kept at $0^{\\circ}$. This is corroborated from the historical data presented in Raymer (Figure 4.2) and Roskam Part 2(Table 6.3). One can also make quarter chord sweep equal to zero. The $n^{th}$ and $m^{th}$ fraction chord sweep angles can be linked using\n",

    "Shape of the wing is determined by aspect ratio, sweep, and taper ratio which are determined based historical data for now based are later optimized after initial design.\n",
