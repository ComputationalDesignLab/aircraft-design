# Introduction
This jupyter-book provides a Python-based implementation for performing some of the conceptual aircraft design tasks
as part of AAE 451 Aircraft Design taught by **Prof. Leifur Leifsson** at Purdue University. The jupyter-book is created
and maintained by the [**Computational Design (CODE) Laboratory**](https://www.computationaldesignlab.org/). After going
through this jupyter-book, the reader will be able to perform several conceptual aircraft design tasks in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of undergraduate level aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, stability and control
- Basic python programming and ability to work with numpy, scipy, and matplotlib

<!-- ## Expected learning outcomes
After going through this jupyter-book, the reader will:
- Be able to initial weight estimation of the airplane
- Perform constraint analysis to identify parameters such as wing loading and power/thrust loading
- Compute wing planform variables
- 

In short, reader will be able to perform several conceptual aircraft design tasks in Python. -->
