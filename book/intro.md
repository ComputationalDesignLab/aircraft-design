# Introduction
This jupyter-book provides a Python-based implementation for performing important conceptual aircraft design activties
as part of AAE 451 Aircraft Design course taught by **Prof. Leifur Leifsson** at Purdue University. The jupyter-book is created
and maintained by the [**Computational Design (CODE) Laboratory**](https://www.computationaldesignlab.org/). After going
through this jupyter-book, the reader will be able to perform several conceptual aircraft design tasks in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of undergraduate level aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, stability and control
- Basic python programming and ability to work with numpy, scipy, and matplotlib

## Learning resources
Following is a list of some of the aircraft design books:
- *Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach* by Daniel Raymer
- *Fundamentals of Aircraft and Airship Design: Volume 1 - Aircraft Design* by Leland Nicolai and Grant Carichner
- *Airplane Design (Volumes I-VIII)* by Jan Roskam
- *General Aviation Aircraft Design: Applied Methods and Procedures* by Snorri Gudmundsson
- *Commercial Airplane Design Principles* by Pasquale Sforza 

<!-- ## Expected learning outcomes
After going through this jupyter-book, the reader will:
- Be able to initial weight estimation of the airplane
- Perform constraint analysis to identify parameters such as wing loading and power/thrust loading
- Compute wing planform variables
- 

In short, reader will be able to perform several conceptual aircraft design tasks in Python. -->
