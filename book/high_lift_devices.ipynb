    "# High-Lift Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "This section talks about sizing of high-lift (HL) devices to meet maximum $C_L$ requirements for the example airplane. Typically, the goal of a HL device is to modified wing camber and area to enhance the lift generated by the wing. There are various types of HL devices and can be located at leading or trailing edge. Some common types of trailing edge HL devices consists of plain flap, split flap, slotted flap, and fowler flaps. Note that control surfaces (aileron, elevator, and rudder) are usually plain flaps. Some leading edge HL devices include LE slot, LE flap, slats, and kruger flap. Refer to lecture notes and section 12.4.6 in Raymer for a detailed discussion about HL devices and how they modify the lift generated by the wing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example airplane, slotted flaps are used due to its ability to generated to adequate increase in $C_{L_{max}}$ while being simple. Only trailing edge devices are used since there is no need to LE devices. Sizing method consists of a simplified analysis using empirical data and extrapolation from 2D airfoil test data.\n",
