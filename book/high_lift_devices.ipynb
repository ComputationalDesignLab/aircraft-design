    "\n",
    "This section talks about sizing of high-lift devices to meet maximum $C_L$ requirements for the example airplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the goal of high-lift devices is to modified wing camber and area to enhance the lift generated by the wing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of high-lift devices.\n",

    "Commmon types of flaps: Plain, Split, Slotted, and Fowler Flaps\n",
    "\n",
    "control surfaces are usually plain flaps\n",
    "\n",
    "LE devices are required to increase the stall angle of attack, TE devices reduce stall angle\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer figure 12.18 in Raymer for pictorial representation of various types of flaps.\n",
