# Weight and Balance

This section talks about weight and balance analysis for the example airplane. Specifically, weight of major aircraft components are computed using detailed estimation methods. These weights are later used for computing the CG of the airplane in different scenarios such as with fuel and without fuel. This is finally used to plot the CG travel diagram. It is important to estimate the weights as accurately as possible at this stage of design since it will affect performance and cost estimation.

Following topics are covered in this section:

1. Component weight estimation
2. CG estimation
3. CG travel diagram
