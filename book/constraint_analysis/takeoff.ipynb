    "# Takeoff Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [mission specifications](example_aircraft.md), the example aircraft needs to takeoff within 1500 ft of ground roll. Additionally, it should also be able to climb to a distance of 50' above takeoff surface according to CFR [Part 23.2115](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-23/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR0f27e01839859ea/section-23.2115). Schematically, it can be represented as:\n",
