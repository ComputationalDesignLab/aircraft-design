    "# Lateral trim\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes lateral trim analysis for the example airplane under two scenarios: one-engine inoperative and cross-wind conditions. In these scenarios, the rudder should be able to trim the airplane such that sideslip angle $\\beta=0$. In both cases, maximum rudder applied should not exceed $\\pm20^{\\circ}$. One can also use other requirements (such as spin recovery) for verifying/sizing the rudder. Refer to lecture notes, Section 21.6 in Nicolai and Carichner, and Section 16.4.2 in Raymer for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-engine out\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-engine out scenario mentions that rudder should be able to produce enough yawing moment to hold the aircraft at $\\beta=0$ at takeoff speed (1.1 times the stall speed) and CG being at most-aft position. Using yawing moment balance about CG, following condition can be derived (equation 21.24, Nicolai and Carichner) for asymmetric power:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta_r$ is the rudder deflection (rad), $T$ is the thrust from one engine, $D$ is the drag from inoperative engine, $q$ is the dynamic pressure, and $\\bar{Y}_p$ is the distance between the engine and CG, normalized using wing span $b$. Other terms have been defined earlier. Above equation can be solved for required $\\delta_r$ to trim the airplane in one-engine out scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thrust for operative engine is computed using takeoff power from engine and 80% propeller efficiency, while accounting for installation losses. The drag from the inoperative engine is estimated using $D/q$ for feathered propeller described in [parasitic drag section](../aerodynamics/drag_buildup.ipynb#miscellaneous-drag), along with drag from idle engine. The rudder control derivative can be computed using (equation 21.26, Nicolai)\n",
