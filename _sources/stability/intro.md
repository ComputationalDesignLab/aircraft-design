This section performs stability and control analysis for the example airplane.

how to assess the stability and  of the airplane at the conceptual design level.

Raymer Chapter 16

Following topics are covered:

1. Longitudinal stability
2. Lateral stability

Before proceeding to specific topics, it is important to define the sizes for the control surfaces

Note that these parameters can be changed, if required, based on the stability analysis
