    "# Tail Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes tail sizing for the example airplane. In the early stages of design, the tail volume coefficient method is used for initial sizing of tail surfaces. The tail volume coefficient is defined as the tail effectiveness non-dimensionalized using the product of wing area and appropriate length scale. The effectiveness of a tail can be measured using the product of tail area and tail moment arm. The length scale is defined based on whether the coefficient is computed for horizontal or vertical tail. Refer to lecture notes, Raymer section 6.5, Roskam part 2 chapter 8, and Nicolai & Carichner chapter 11 for more details.\n",

    "\n",
    "where $S_h$ and $S$ are the horizontal tail surface and main wing areas, respectively, while $\\bar{c}$ refers to the mean aerodynamic chord of the wing. The $L_h$ is the horizontal tail moment arm, measured as the distance between the mean aerodynamic centers of the horizontal tail surface and the wing. The value of the coefficient and tail moment arm are estimated based on the historical data for a similar class of airplanes. For the example airplane, the $V_h$ and $L_h$ are set to 0.8 and 15 ft, respectively, based on Table 8.3(a) (Roskam Part 2).\n",

    "The planform values for the horizontal tail surface are estimated using the historical data presented in Table 8.13, Roskam Part 2. The aspect ratio is set to 5.5, while taper ratio is 0.75. The quarter chord sweep is set to $10^{\\circ}$ and the dihedral angle is set to $5^{\\circ}$, while the incidence angle is kept variable for trimming purposes. The NACA 0012 is used as the airfoil for the hortizontal tail surface.\n",
