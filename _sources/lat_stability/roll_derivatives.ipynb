    "# Static roll and yaw stability derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "This section computes roll static stability derivative $C_{l_{\\beta}}$ for the example airplane. The thrust effects are neglected for this analysis. Using equation 16.43 in Raymer, roll static stability derivative can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    C_{l_{\\beta}} = C_{l_{\\beta_w}} + C_{l_{\\beta_v}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and second term represent rolling moment contribution from wing and vertical tail, respectively. The fuselage contribution towards rolling is usually based wing-fuselage intersection which is already included in $C_{l_{\\beta_w}}$.\n",

    "The $C_{l_{\\beta_w}}/C_L$ is computed as $-0.02 \\text{ rad}^{-1}$ using Figure 16.21 in Raymer based on the aspect ratio and taper ratio of the wing. The $(C_{l_\\beta})_\\Gamma$ is computed as (equation 16.45, Raymer)\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\Gamma$ is the geometric dihedral angle (in radians), $C_{L_{\\alpha}}$ is the lift-curve slope and $\\lambda$ is the taper ratio. The wing-fuselage interaction is computed using (equation 16.46, Raymer)\n",
