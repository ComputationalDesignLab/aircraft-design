    "# Payload-Range diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "This section describes how to create a payload-range diagram for the example airplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four critical points that essentially define the diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Full payload + zero range: This point defines the point from the payload range diagram starts on y-axis.\n",
    "2. Full payload + fuel at MTOW: this point refers to the design point\n",
    "3. MTOW + max fuel: at this point, the plane is filled with maximum fuel based on the fuel tank capacity. Note that fuel at MTOW with full payload is less than the maximum allowable fuel.\n",
    "4. No payload + maximum fuel: this point refers to a case where the airplane is flying no payload, essentially the ferry range\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two points are known, only points 3 and 4 requires some computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the one should include the reserve mission fuel while computing the range\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuel should take into account the reserve mission\n",
    "\n",
    "Only thing that changes is the fuel weight, it is varied from zero fuel for the range segment to fuel at MTOW to the maximum fuel capacity of tanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you need to compute the fuel capacity of the tanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined by the four points on the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Full payload with zero range (known)\n",
    "2. full payload with fuel to yield Max TO (known)\n",
    "3. Full fuel with not full payload but still at MAx TO\n",
    "4. Full fuel but no payload (but with crews) \n",
    "\n",
    "Few things to determine\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Volume of the fuel tanks\n",
    "2. Amount of fuel that will be spent for cruise segment"
